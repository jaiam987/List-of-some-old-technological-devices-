  <p align="justify">A typewriter is a device which prints   letters one at a time on a medium such as paper when the user presses   keys on the keyboard. Before the advent of word processors and   computers, the typewriter was the only   way for people to produce printed text in an efficient and rapid manner,   and typewriters in fact continue to be used in some offices today. Many   fine examples of antique typewriters can be seen in some museums, along   with examples of innovations such as typeballs and electric   typewriters.</p>
  <p align="justify">The earliest versions of the typewriter began to appear around the 1700s, but the development of the typewriter   really entered its full flower in the 1800s, and while the design was   refined a bit in the 1900s, it remained fundamentally the same. There   are a several main parts to the typewriter: the keyboard, the typing levers, an ink ribbon, and the platen, all encased in a housing which protects the innards of the typewriter.</p>
  <p align="justify">The platen is the section of the typewriter which holds the paper. Most platens are rollers which advance the paper with each line, so that the typist can focus on the typing. To use the typewriter,   the typist presses a key which activates a lever attached to the   corresponding letter, number, or symbol. As the lever is pushed forward,   it strikes a ribbon which is impregnated with ink, and then the paper,   leaving an impression of the desired symbol behind.</p>
