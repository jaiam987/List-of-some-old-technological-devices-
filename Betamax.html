  <p align="justify"><strong>Betamax</strong> (sometimes called <strong>Beta</strong>) is a consumer-level analog recording videocassette magnetic tape recording format developed by Sony, released on May 10, 1975. The cassettes contain 1/2-inch (12.7mm)-wide videotape in a design similar to the earlier, professional &frac34; inches (1.9&nbsp;cm) wide, U-matic format. The format is considered obsolete, though it is still used in specialist applications by a small minority of people.</p>
  <p align="justify">Like the rival videotape format VHS (introduced in Japan by JVC in October 1976<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax#cite_note-0"></a> and in the US by RCA in August 1977), Betamax had no guard band and used azimuth recording to reduce crosstalk. According to Sony's own history webpages, the name came from a double meaning: <em>beta</em> being the Japanese word used to describe the way signals were recorded   onto the tape, and from the fact that when the tape ran through the   transport, it looked like the Greek letter beta (&beta;). The suffix <em>-max</em> came from &quot;maximum&quot;, to suggest greatness.</p>
