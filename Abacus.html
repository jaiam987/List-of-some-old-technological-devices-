  <p align="justify">An abacus is a form of manually   operated counting aid which has been around for thousands of years.   Abaci continue to be used in parts of Asia and Middle East, especially   in shops, and they can often be acquired in stores which stock Chinese   or Japanese goods. In the West, the abacus   is sometimes used as a teaching tool to help young children grasp   numbers, and some mathematicians enjoy experimenting with the abacus to work out simple problems.</p>
  <p align="justify">The design of an abacus   varies, depending on the region of the world it is from, but generally   it consists of a frame which supports rods or wires. The rods hold beads   which can be moved around on the frame to represent various numbers. In   some cases, an abacus has a crossbeam   which divides the rods; the beads above the beam are multiples of five,   while those below are multiples of one. Each rod in an abacus represents a decimal place.</p>
  <p align="justify">&rdquo;Abacus&rdquo; comes from the Greek <em>abax</em>,   which means &ldquo;counting board.&rdquo; The Greeks used boards covered in sand to   draw out equations as they worked on them, and they probably picked up   the habit from the Hebrews, who used the word <em>abaq</em> to describe a counting board. Both  the Greeks and Romans used various forms of the abacus;   the Romans favored boards with grooves and beads or rocks, for example.   The counting frame style with rods and beads appears to have originated   in China.</p>
