  <p align="justify">Pagers are one of the simplest telecommunication devices in use today.  Used primarily for short messages, the pager   is often utilized by a number of professionals in various disciplines.    Prior to the widespread use of cell phones, personal pagers tended to   be the main technology used to make quick one way and two way   communications when a phone call to a land line was not possible.  Even   with the popularity of cell phones today, many businesses still consider   the pager to be a viable form of communication. </p>
  <p align="justify"> The concept of paging was first introduced in the 1950&rsquo;s.  At the time, the main function for pagers was to reach healthcare personnel in the event of an emergency.  The basic premise for the portable   pagers was built on the use of internal paging systems that were common   in hospitals of the day.  Use of the portable device made it possible to   reach a doctor when he or she was outside the facility and could not be   contacted with the use of a telephone. </p>
  <p align="justify">From this simple beginning, the pager   continued to advance.  While the first pagers had a rather limited   range, advances in telephony and related technologies made it possible   for the pager to receive a signal from fifty to a hundred miles away.  As the device became more user friendly, use of the pager   began to spread to professions other than healthcare.  By the 1980&rsquo;s,   everyone from attorneys to security guards were carrying pagers. </p>
